# Open-Source Ethical AI Toolkit for Bias Detection

## Overview
This toolkit provides functionality to train a machine learning model and assess its fairness across sensitive attributes, like race and gender. 
Metrics such as Demographic Parity Difference, Disparate Impact, and Statistical Parity Difference are calculated and visualized, 
helping identify any potential biases in model predictions.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the `bias_detection.py` file to execute the bias detection module:
```bash
python bias_detection.py
```

## Metrics Explained
- **Demographic Parity Difference**: Measures how similarly the model treats different demographic groups.
- **Disparate Impact**: Ideally close to 1, this metric shows the relative rate of positive predictions for privileged vs. unprivileged groups.
- **Statistical Parity Difference**: Ideally near 0, this metric compares the rate of positive outcomes across groups.

## Visualization
After execution, a bar chart will display fairness metrics, aiding interpretation of potential biases.
