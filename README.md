# Open-Source Ethical AI Toolkit for Bias and Ethical Screening in Search Results and News Media

## Overview
This toolkit provides functionalities to:
1. Detect bias digital content and within machine learning models across sensitive attributes like race, gender, even geopotical and socioeconomic status.
2. Evaluate ethical standards through explainability and privacy checks.
3. Utilize AI to scrape ethical journalist news sites and unbiased sources to generate a transparent, neutral, and informed news source.
4. Provide Unbiased and Non-targeted Search Results.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   cd open_source_ai_toolkit
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:

   ```

4. **Run the Toolkit**:
   To execute the toolkit, simply run:
   ```bash
   python run_toolkit.py
   ```

## Explanation of Files

- **bias_detection.py**: Handles bias detection using metrics like Demographic Parity and Disparate Impact.
- **ethical_screening.py**: Contains functions for explainability (LIME, SHAP) and privacy checks.
- **run_toolkit.py**: Integrates the toolkit, running both bias detection and ethical screening.

## Metrics Explained

- **Demographic Parity Difference**: Measures prediction equality across groups.
- **Disparate Impact**: Compares favorable outcomes for privileged vs. unprivileged groups (ideal value near 1).
- **Statistical Parity Difference**: Indicates rate of positive outcomes across groups (closer to 0 is ideal).
