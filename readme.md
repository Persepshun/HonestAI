## Overview
This toolkit provides functionalities to:
1. Detect bias in machine learning models across sensitive attributes like race and gender.
2. Evaluate ethical standards through explainability and privacy checks.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/open_source_ai_toolkit.git
   cd open_source_ai_toolkit
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Toolkit**:
   To execute the toolkit, simply run:
   ```bash
   python run_toolkit.py
   ```

## Explanation of Files

- **bias_detection.py**: Handles bias detection using metrics like Demographic Parity and Disparate Impact.
- **ethical_screening.py**: Contains functions for explainability (LIME, SHAP) and privacy checks.
- **run_toolkit.py**: Integrates the toolkit, running both bias detection and ethical screening.

## Metrics Explained

- **Demographic Parity Difference**: Measures prediction equality across groups.
- **Disparate Impact**: Compares favorable outcomes for privileged vs. unprivileged groups (ideal value near 1).
- **Statistical Parity Difference**: Indicates rate of positive outcomes across groups (closer to 0 is ideal).
